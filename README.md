This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
AI-Powered Recipe Generator
This is a full-stack web application built with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS that leverages Hugging Face’s language models to generate cooking recipes based on user-provided ingredients.

Features
Responsive and user-friendly interface for ingredient input and recipe display.

Integration with Hugging Face NLP models to create dynamic, AI-generated recipes.

Basic authentication system including user registration, login, and session management.

Backend logic handled via Next.js API routes with simple data persistence using SQLite.

JSON-based recipe data management for easy manipulation and storage.

Designed for scalability to support features like user favorites, recipe categorization, and AI-driven image generation in future updates.

## Environment Variables

For persistent data on Vercel, set MongoDB environment variables:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
MONGODB_DB=home_cooking
SESSION_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-string
```

Optional local-only SQLite override:

```bash
DATABASE_PATH=/absolute/path/to/database.db
```

When `MONGODB_URI` is set, API routes use MongoDB as primary storage.
If it is missing, the app falls back to SQLite.
